  <h6 style="color:rgb(56, 56, 167)">SEAtile is an outcome to a research looking at an Interior product made of seaweed and local materials promoting circular economy that provides better environmental performance than its predecessors.It is a product system change with integration of 3 major sectors through material science for a low impact living. Combining interior architecture , construction and proposed sustainable seaweed farming industry in Australia.</h6>

  <h6>According to current statitics,<em>70%</em> of all infrastructure we would be needing by <em>2030</em> have not even been built.</h6>
  <p>Because data shows that , 70% of infrastructure we would be using in near future has not even been built yet and to carry out a well planned construction, material is a dominant factor  governing the whole system.This here shows the most Common building materials used in Australia with their flow percentage and how the top four choices are of no surprise. But all the materials have one thing in common, the high embodied energy as a result of transportation and industrial heat requirement.Generally, the traditional life cycle for most of the materials looks like this with some additions and subtractions in the process following a cradle to grave system of manufacturing that involves use of materials coming from longer distances.Not only do they have huge hidden costs tied into them but also  have a huge direct and indirect contribution to carbon emissions of the country coming from construction sector alone.
  <a href="#stationaryenergyflowdiagram">Go to Stationary energy</a>
  These emission breakdown have a huge percentage towards stationary energy and building materials. Where to a surprise, Australia, that manufactures millions of tonnes of Ceramic (products involving bricks and tiles) -  are the most unsustainable. <i>Material Manufacturing contributes 27% towards emissions that’s a direct factor of process heat required to heat up the huge machineries and creating fugitive emissions in return.</i> Ceramic due to the current choice of raw materials including quite a few non-renewable minerals requires to be manufactured at the highest temperature ranges – making the overall material system very unsustainable.</p>
  <h4><strong style="color:rgb(221, 182, 75)">"Zero Carbon Australia Stationary Energy Plan"</strong>implementation would mean <b>28%</b>reduction in Australias's carbon emissions.</h4>
  <p>Tremendous effort is required to advocate low and/or neutral carbon construction at various stages through effective <b>DESIGN.</b> It can help us understand and negate possibilities to reduce global carbon emissions to help combat climate change and transition into a more sustainable future.In the current system that makes its way into 10% recycling adapting cradle to cradle principles of sustainable living could be a probable future, but 10% is not enough to make a change. Therefore, If we concentrate on the future we need rather than the future we want, an empirical design shift into local manufacturing would be a preferable future following a circular closed loop system.These are some of my inspirations - developing bio-inspired products aiming towards the same ideology. They are tweaking the recipe of building materials by utilizing the potential of various geopolymers.Inorganic Geopolymers have been used for quite a while in concrete solutions. But I am proposing to do the same using Alginate – a natural biopolymer polysaccharide derived from Brown seaweed,  that has been used commercially as a food thicker and edible films but not commonly in the raw form. </p>
  <p>IMTA blue economy seaweed industry being proposed by Australian Seaweed Institute and Agrifutures Australia is a potential collaboration forms a base for a system change into local manufacturing. Sustainable Seaweed Farming  needs no maintenance, or additional nutrients, it grows very fast, cleans water and traps carbon out of the atmosphere, making it a perfect partner for my proposal.</p>

<p>Current proposal suggests re-designing a tile leaving brick as a part of stage II research study.This here is the products life cycle, where the 3 sectors work in sync with each other to create a sustainable circular loop from extraction of raw materials to manufacturing, installation and recycling.</p>
<p><strong>It starts, from gathering of harvested seaweed from the IMTA blue economy seaweed farms Tasmania and Port Philip Bay.</strong>

Amongst the many species of seaweed, a few brown ones are used for developing the product at this stage, with a potential for involving all the suitable species of seaweed.Next is MANUFACTURING where the dried seaweed is used to develop biopolymer activated clay composition in the presence of alkali and alginate. The stabilised clay rearranges the dissolved atoms in a bare minimum heat between 80 to 100 degree Celsius to form a strong dense structure. The clay composition thus formed can be extruded to shape the tile with absolutely no firing required.At the end of its life cycle , it can be possibly recycled by disintegration and crushing. through the biological system. The separated seaweed fibers are utilized as biochar, fertilizers or cattle feed and the clay gets technically recycled to be used again as a raw material (currently based on hypothesis as COVID19 has resulted in insufficient material testing).
Apart from being 100% recyclable, SEAtile has the ability to capture carbon in the home setting while providing a sensory sea experience through its visual and tactile qualities.</p>
